# Sarcasmfest Rules
The contribution should follow the casing rule and convert `This does not align with our core values` into Sarcasm case.\
The program and any additional files should be put into it's own folder on this repo that is named your username. IE: `/Li223/Sarcasm.cs`

# Casing Rules
\> The rules apply to the string as a whole and isn't done by sentences\
\> The casing ignores special characters and empty space(s)\
\> The start can begin with either a lower case or upper case character\
\> The letter before and after the current letter need to be the opposite case to the current letter

TLDR; The text can start in either lower or upper case, but the case proceeding that must be the opposite while also ignoring spaces and special characters.

Correct Example: `cOrReCt ExAmPlE`\
Incorrect Example: `incoRrEct EXaMplE` - The casing doesnt follow the correct pattern\
Incorrect Example: `iNcOrEcT ExAmPlE` - This one is including the space which is ignored in the casing rules.\
Incorrect Example: `ThIs Is WrOnG. It CoUlD'Ve BeEn CoRrEcT` - This one includes the special characters which are ignored in the casing rules
