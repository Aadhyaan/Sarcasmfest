This quote brought to you by the hacktoberfest team TM.

Basically this repo is mocking them as some repos they've marked as spam were merely aimed at getting beginners into OSS and Hacktoberfest itself (See RaidAndFade's challenges). 

# What do I do
Commit a program that converts "This repo does not align with our core values" into what I've dubbed SaRcAsM cAsE, in the most long winded horrible way you can.

# Has this repo been marked as spam yet?
No - 4/10
